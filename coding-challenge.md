# iOS Coding Challenge

## Overview

We've put together a little challenge to get a feel for your coding skills
and how you handle external APIs. Don't sweat it—this is a fun way for
us to see your approach and problem-solving chops.

Take a look at the objective below and make sure to reach out if you have any
questions or need some help understanding the details.

## Objective

Your goal is to build a simple master-detail iOS app using Swift that
interacts with an external API. You can SwiftUI or UIKit. You will need to fetch a list of
photos using the [Lorem Picsum API](https://picsum.photos/v2/list) and
display them in a list. If the user taps on a photo in the list take them to a details screen. 

## Requirements

1. Your list screen should at minimum display the photo
2. Tapping a photo in the list take the user to the details for that photo
3. On the details screen display the photo, author, id, size, and URL.
4. Have fun. If you want to add an extra feature or embellishment, go for it. 

## Bonus

1. Add loading and error states

## Example

We’ve included an example of what the finished product could look like for
reference but feel free to give it your own spin
